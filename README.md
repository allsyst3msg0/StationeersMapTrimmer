StationeersMapTrimmer
=====================


## Trimmer?

Due to the way Stationeers and many other dynamically generated voxel based games handle terrain, it often makes sense to trim (or delete) the world outside of your core area on a regular basis. This ensures that the game engine does not need to remember those far away regions that you've once visited for a quick mining trip and tests have shown that this reduces the game memory footprint and improves load time on both local and dedicated servers.

This utility allows you to visualize your base and any piece of land that exists around it and then to trim those unwanted areas by selecting the portion that you want to keep.

The same executable contains both a graphical interface (GUI) and a command line (CLI) that are made available for Windows, Mac and Linux, making this tool suitable for dedicated servers too.


## Downloads

## Contributers

I wish to convey special thanks to:

- MrDrummer25
- EJ_SA (https://twitch.tv/ej_sa)
- Masoneer (https://twitch.tv/masoneer)
- GamersCircle (https://www.twitch.tv/gamerscircle)

I discovered Stationeers with you guys and your ideas and support are very appreciated. Keep up the great work!


## Coming up

A great deal of features are in the pipeline but these are the main ones coming up:

- Improved loading messages (in-progress)
- Undo an apply (planned)
- Terraforming (planned)
- 3d visualization (tested / de-risked)


## Code Signing Certificates

I unfortunately don't have code signing certificates setup for any of the supported platforms. Those are usually expensive and on top of that they often require a yearly renewal. I am open to [donations](#donations) if you are willing to help on that front but in the meantime here are the side effects that you might experience:

On Windows you might get a blue popup saying `Windows protected your PC - Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized application from starting. Running this application might put your PC at risk.` Then giving you the option to run it anyway.

On Mac, the application might yield the following message: `"StationeersMapTrimmer" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.` You can head to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and you will then see a button next to `Allow apps downloaded from` allowing you to launch the program.

On Linux all is good!


## Anti-Virus

The binaries for all three operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) are generated on a Linux environment and are scanned for viruses using the latest version of [ClamAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam_AntiVirus), a well known and respected AntiVirus in the community.


## Open source

An eventual goal is to open source this project in full or in parts, I understand the benefits of having a healthy open source community but there are a couple things I want to clean-up/re-factor and additional features that I want to implement before I reach that point. In the meantime I am open to suggestions and will gladly consider them for future releases.
